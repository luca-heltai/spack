Description:
   ARPACK-NG is a collection of Fortran77 subroutines designed to solve
  large scale eigenvalue problems. Important Features: * Reverse
  Communication Interface. * Single and Double Precision Real Arithmetic
  Versions for Symmetric, Non-symmetric, Standard or Generalized Problems.
  * Single and Double Precision Complex Arithmetic Versions for Standard
  or Generalized Problems. * Routines for Banded Matrices - Standard or
  Generalized Problems. * Routines for The Singular Value Decomposition. *
  Example driver routines that may be used as templates to implement
  numerous Shift-Invert strategies for all problem types, data types and
  precision. This project is a joint project between Debian, Octave and
  Scilab in order to provide a common and maintained version of arpack.
  Indeed, no single release has been published by Rice university for the
  last few years and since many software (Octave, Scilab, R, Matlab...)
  forked it and implemented their own modifications, arpack-ng aims to
  tackle this by providing a common repository and maintained versions.
  arpack-ng is replacing arpack almost everywhere.

Description:
  CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model invented by
  NVIDIA. It enables dramatic increases in computing performance by
  harnessing the power of the graphics processing unit (GPU). Note: NVIDIA
  does not provide a download URL for CUDA so you will need to download it
  yourself. Go to https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads and select
  your Operating System, Architecture, Distribution, and Version. For the
  Installer Type, select runfile and click Download. Spack will search
  your current directory for this file. Alternatively, add this file to a
  mirror so that Spack can find it. For instructions on how to set up a
  mirror, see http://software.llnl.gov/spack/mirrors.html Note: This
  package does not currently install the drivers necessary to run CUDA.
  These will need to be installed manually. See:
  http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-getting-started-guide-for-linux for
